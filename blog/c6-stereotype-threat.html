    <h2 class="scripthead">Stereotype Threats</h2>
    <p class="pinktext">
      I never knew I had a southern accent until I moved from my hometown in Memphis, TN to Orlando, FL for an internship. It still wasn't for another month that I noticed anything different about myself until someone repeated a sentence back to me with a strange voice. I was confused, but soon it was clear that I did not dictate my thoughts with the unaccented clarity that I had hoped was leaving my mouth. The jokes that followed were completely harmless and usually quite funny, but nonetheless, I strove to lose the accent and never mention the few country songs I actually enjoyed.

        Something as small as suppressing accents really isn't that big of a deal. We do it all the time when speaking to different groups. You don't speak the same way with your boss as you do your peers. It's when those stereotypes suppress your interests or inhibit your ability to think or perform that we find the unfortunate effects of <a href="http://www.diversityinc.com/diversity-events/the-stereotype-threat-dr-claude-steele-mesmerizes-audience-video/">Stereotype Threat</a>, originally coined by social psychologist Dr. Claude Steele.

        I realized fairly quickly that when I was able to lose the accent with other people, they thought I was smarter, and, in a way, I felt more educated and confident, too. The problem is that this can quickly devolve into imposter's syndrom, where you don't feel like you belong and fear being "found out". Oftentimes, attempting to alleviate any indications of the negative side of these stereotype threats actually harms us in performance anyway.

      <h2 class="scripthead">Pairing</h2>
        <p class="pinktext">
          Over the last few years, I've learned to embrace my unique background. I've reached an nice balance of being able to enjoy the rare instances of jokes while also being taken seriously in the workforce. Ironically, I feel that while I'm leaving a stage of fearing the southern stereotype, I seem to be entering a fear of being stereotyped as I enter into the tech world for my career. I constantly doubt my intellectual abilities based off my gender and background.

          If I don't feel confident in myself to succeed based on stereotypes, then how can I expect the rest of Silicon Valley to ignore them?
