    <p class="pinktext">This week with my DBC work, we finally delved into Ruby. I was pretty both excited and terrified as we're now entering territory that I have no familiarity with at all. And somehow I made it through and I've even got a bit of knowledge to show for it. In the world of programming, learning the different languages is surprisingly similar to learning human language. There's nouns (well, objects, really) and even verbs or, in this case, methods. I'm happy to introduce two different objects I met this week: Arrays and Hashes. Each host many different objects, but how they host them is the key to understanding the differences.</p>
<h2 class ="scripthead">Arrays</h2>
    <p>Arrays are the hub of storing data, like say, a list of your peers from high school...</p>

    <p>Of course, you can combine multiple arrays into one...</p>
    <img src ="imgs/class_of_2008_new.png"/>
    <p>You can even do things like see how many people you graduated (count how many things are in the array, which could also be numbers)</p>
    <img src="imgs/class_of_2008.size.png"/>
    <p> But what if I wanted to attach valuable information to each of these people in the Class of 2008? Arrays are great for lists of people, numbers, anything really, but if we want to link each item to another piece a data, flash the Hash signal in the sky!
  <h2 class ="scripthead">Hashes</h2>
    <p>Hashes are fantastic things that have keys (must be a unique name or object) linked to values (can be the same as other values). In our example thus far, your name would be a key. Let's create a hash for everyone's GPA's...</p>

    <p>You'll notice that I named that hash "north_shore_gpas" and each student was linked to their GPA with this combination of symbols: =>

      And all of that was wonderfully wrapped up in curly brackets.
