    <p class="pinktext">This week with my DBC work, I really struggled with positioning and it seemed that a lot of my peers did as well. One concept I just couldn't quite understand was the difference between setting something as an inline element and an inline-block element. </p>
<h2 class ="scripthead">Inline Elements</h2>
    <p>Inline elements are objects on a page that get along well with their neighbors in that they will share the space around them (to the left and right, that is). These are thinks like links and images (by default, anyway). They flow with the text and objects around them, without breaking a line. Although, in this analogy, they would have an unlimited building permit in terms of height as you cannot set their width and height.</p>
  <h2 class ="scripthead">Inline-Block Elements</h2>
    <p>Inline-block elements are similar in that they, too, get along with their neighbors and do not break into a new line. They DO follow the building permits you set, so if you only want them to exist up to a certain height or width, they would abide by these "laws". They also obey your margin commands, which work a bit like the land in front of your house with the sidewalk on it. It's not your land, it's a buffer provided between the street, or, in this case, your border for the element. </p>
