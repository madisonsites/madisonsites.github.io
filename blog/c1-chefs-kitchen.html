      As someone who has been only slightly touched by the world of Silicon Valley through our developers at work, I really don't know that I had any expectations for DBC. All I knew is that I was going to meet some cool people at a similar juncture in their lives and learn something that was far beyond anything I had ever done before, supported almost solely by the encouragement of my roommate and friend who truly believed that I was capable of doing well enough to "pass" but to do so awesomely.

        I'm already amazed by my other cohort participants. They're unbelievably eager to help and own up to questions which is comforting to a girl who has never stepped foot into a basic programming class and lives in fear of failing.

        I predict that this type of environment will vastly change me as not only a learner, but a human. I've already started on a journey to learning more about mindfulness and practicing meditation more frequently. What I originally thought was going to be a fast-paced cram session of learning Ruby on Rails has already become something that has affected how I view the world and myself entirely.

        I spent most of my first week working through Phase 0 in absolute fear that I was not qualified to "be here". To have this chance to do something that feels like too much of a stretch. It's hard to be a student again after a few years working fairly independently and successfully, but after watching a recent video, I realized that I am qualified. I made it through the interview. I made it through the pre-requisites. My friends clearly saw enough in me to direct me this way.
        <p>
        It's easy to say now that I'm feeling more confident, but I'm looking forward to the challenge.
