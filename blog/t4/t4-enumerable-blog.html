      Hello world!
      </p>
      <p>
      I don't think I can manage a single blog post without a silly pun. Ever.

      Anyway, I'm a huge fan of travel and maps. The more I travel, the more I understand geography better and, more importantly, humans.

      None of this, unfortuantely, helped me in my comprehension of map when it came to Ruby this week.
      </p>

      map is one of those things that my friends often offer as part of a solution to any of my exercises when I'm stuck and asking for help. Well, the time finally came for us to learn them so I couldn't use "we haven't covered that yet, so I shouldn't use it" as an excuse any longer. So, in an effort to solidify my own understanding, I would like to present to you:

      map

        <p class="pinktext">
        map is a great tool to use for arrays (essentially a list). In this example, since we're talking about maps, I'm going to create an array of my travels.
    </p>

    <p class="pinktext">
        It looks like that in my hurry to write everything down I wasn't much of a stickler in terms of capitalization. And, despite this, I happen to be botherd by poor or lacking capitals, so this needs fixing and map is just the guy for the job.
        </p>

        <p class="pinktext">
        As you'll see above, I used print so I could see what is output.
        Next, we have my_travels.map, which is calling map to be applied to my list of countries. I defined them in the variable my_travels.

        In the curly brackets, I define another variable within the pipes (||). I could have called it ketchup if I wanted, but country will do just fine as it shows us what map is looking at: each of the countries I listed.

        Finally, like an ignorant husband, you have to be undeniably explicit in what you need accomplished, so I list my new variable (which the program will read as each of the countries individuall as it runs through all of them) with a call to capitalize them as it processes through.

        In the end, we get a nice new array:
        </p>

        <p class="pinktext">
        So, there you have it. That's map. It takes an array, formats it however you want, and returns it as another array that is uniquely its own.
        </p>
        <p class="pinktext">
        If, for any reason, you feel like you still need more map in your life, I highly recommend one of my favorite sub-Reddits, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/">Map Porn</a>.
