        <h3>Javascript Functions</h3>
        <p>JavaScript functions are defined in one of two ways: constructor and literal notation.</p>
        <h4>Constructor</h4>
        <p>The constructor (AKA declaration) function is defined with the word <code>function</code> before the name of the function you give it, followed by the inputs it accept, and finally, the actual code between curly braces</p>
        <pre>
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
        </pre>
        <p>The constructor way of defining a function uses <code>this</code> as a means to reference the current object. The current object can be the function itself or a newly defined object in the function. In constructor, new objects are defined with a <code>=</code>. Semicolons are totes optional. Most importantly is that the scope of constructor functions is available even above wherever the function is set</p>

        <h4>Literal</h4>
        <p>Literal notation looks like this: </p>
        <pre>
var add = function(a,b) {
    return a + b;
}
        </pre>
        <p>The literal notation does not use 'this' to reference above objects; it utilizes variables within the block. These are defined with a <code>:</code> instead of the equal sign that we saw in constructor. Finally, semicolons are required after every property or method within the function (in constructor they were optional). </p>
