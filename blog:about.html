  <h2 class="scripthead">The Roots</h2>
  <p class ="pinktext">
    I'm a blended soul of both the south and the west coast. I grew up in Memphis, TN where I led a fairly quiet life through high school. From there, I relented to going to the local university, the University of Memphis, following the advice of my parents instead of going away like I so desperately wanted. In the end, it worked out, as it usually does, and I had far more opportunities to travel because of my major (Hospitality), minor (French), and the support the school received (from my full ride to the many work/study abroad opportunities). With the University of Memphis, I was able to study in Panama, France, and even take an internship in China after graduation. I was never fully meant to stay in Tennessee, so I ended up where my soul felt like it really belonged, here on the west coast. I'll never be a complete Californian, I left a huge part of my heart in Memphis, but I've really found a home here in the Bay Area.
