							<p>
								I never knew I had a southern accent until I moved from my hometown in Memphis, TN to Orlando, FL for an internship. It still wasn't for another month that I noticed anything different about myself until someone repeated a sentence back to me with a strange voice. I was confused, but soon it was clear that I did not dictate my thoughts with the unaccented clarity that I had hoped was leaving my mouth. <a href="posts/c6-stereotype-threat.html">Read more...</a>

							<p>
								When we were first introduced to the concept of pairing through problems, I was, well, apprehensive to say the least. The idea of waiting on someone else or, worse, holding others back was terrifying and frustrating to me. <a href="posts/c5-feedback.html">Read more...</a>

							<p>
								As irony would have it, I was never much of a feminist. As the only girl in a clan of four kids, I always ran with the boys. They comprised a majority of my friends and have been my favorite roommates. In my old life, back in Tennessee, I never once felt the need to be a feminist. I felt the work and pay was fair for me and my other co-workers, male and female. The ones who didn't usually didn't seem to be working very hard anyway. <a href="posts/c4-tech-probs.html">Read more...</a>

								Hello world! I don't think I can manage a single blog post without a silly pun. Ever. Anyway, I'm a huge fan of travel and maps. The more I travel, the more I understand geography better and, more importantly, humans. <a href="posts/t4-enumerable-blog.html">Read more...</a>

							<p>
								This week with my DBC work, we finally delved into Ruby. I was pretty both excited and terrified as we're now entering territory that I have no familiarity with at all. And somehow I made it through and I've even got a bit of knowledge to show for it. In the world of programming, learning the different languages is surprisingly similar to learning human language. <a href="posts/t3-arrays-hashes">Read more...</a>

							<p>
								This week with my DBC work, I really struggled with positioning and it seemed that a lot of my peers did as well. One concept I just couldn't quite understand was the difference between setting something as an inline element and an inline-block element. <a href="posts/t2-css-design.html">Read more...</a>

							<p>
								As someone who has been only slightly touched by the world of Silicon Valley through our developers at work, I really don't know that I had any expectations for DBC. All I knew is that I was going to meet some cool people at a similar juncture in their lives and learn something that was far beyond anything I had ever done before, supported almost solely by the encouragement of my roommate and friend who truly believed that I was capable of doing well enough to "pass" but to do so awesomely. <a href="posts/c1-chefs-kitchen.html">Read more...</a>
