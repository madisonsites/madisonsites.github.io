<h1>About</h1>
  <p>Welcome to the project page of Madison Sites. This, like my little developer life, is a work-in-progress. I'll be looking forward to getting your feedback as soon as I learn how to actually get it from you. :D</p>

<h2>My Story</h2>
  <p>I was born and raised in Memphis, TN, where I also attended the University of Memphis for a bachelor's degree in Hospitality and a minor in French (salut!). I landed in the San Francisco Bay Area by way of China (that's a long story) since 2012 and have called it home ever since. I'm now in the midst of learning to become a developer through Dev Bootcamp. You can follow the latest updates at the blog section of this site.

<h3>My Maps</h3>
  <p>I love to travel, which is why I'm hoping to use a portion of this site to host a map of my travels and the places I've called home through the years.</p>

<h4>Contact</h4>
  <p>While I'm in the process of learning, I welcome any and all of your feedback through the following platforms:</p>
