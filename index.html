<h1 class ="scripthead">About</h1>
  <p class="basictext">Welcome to the project page of Madison Sites. This, like my little developer life, is a work-in-progress. I'll be looking forward to getting your feedback as soon as I learn how to actually get it from you. :D</p>

<h1 class ="scripthead">My Story</h1>
    <p class="basictext">I was born and raised in Memphis, TN, where I also attended the University of Memphis for a bachelor's degree in Hospitality and a minor in French (salut!). I landed in the San Francisco Bay Area by way of China (that's a long story) since 2012 and have called it home ever since. I'm now in the midst of learning to become a developer through Dev Bootcamp. You can follow the latest updates at the blog section of this site.</p>

<h1 class ="scripthead">My Maps</h1>
  <p class="basictext">I love to travel, which is why I'm hoping to use a portion of this site to host a map of my travels and the places I've called home through the years.</p>
