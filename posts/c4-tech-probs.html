					As irony would have it, I was never much of a feminist. As the only girl in a clan of four kids, I always ran with the boys. They comprised a majority of my friends and have been my favorite roommates. In my old life, back in Tennessee, I never once felt the need to be a feminist. I felt the work and pay was fair for me and my other co-workers, male and female. The ones who didn't usually didn't seem to be working very hard anyway.
				</p>

    			<p>
    				Everything changed when I moved to Silicon Valley, though, and even though I wasn't working in a full-capacity tech company, I had moved out of a female-ruled hospitality industry into a completely different realm, and it showed. I worked several jobs, some even in hospitality, and found that I was working hard than the boys and still getting denied for raises, despite bringing in what I felt like was sufficient data. Had I moved up the ranks enough before leaving Tennessee, I would have likely found the same frustrations, even had I stayed in hospitality. A broad assumption, I know, but I've heard it from friends that stayed behind enough to feel comfortable making it.
				</p>

    			<p>
    				It's a relief to see that we as society, and in particular the culture of Silicon Valley, is recognizing the discrimination. It's the first step in the problem. And while I'm not sure where I stand on the Ellen Pao case, it certainly brought the issue more light. I do fear that this isn't enough.
				</p>

       			<p>
       				I don't want to see us waste this opportunity to make great change by only talking about it. I don't want to continue to see the social excuses of "well, I have a black/female/minority friend". These get us no where. I want action. I want to see companies taking small steps to test their effectiveness. Maybe removing names and ages when reviewing resumes - as sadly age is also discriminated against here as well. Studies have shown that simply including "salary negotiable" encourages women to negotiate enough that it closes the pay gap by <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w18511">45%</a>. One of my deepest fears is finishing Dev Bootcamp and having no leads on a job. This is of course only heightened with these discriminations. I know the problem can't possible be solved by the end of October when I graduate, but I hope to see enough progress to feel comfortable around my co-workers in a field I'm quickly falling in love with otherwise.
