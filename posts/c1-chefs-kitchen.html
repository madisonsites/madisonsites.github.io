					As someone who has been only slightly touched by the world of Silicon Valley through our developers at work, I really don't know that I had any expectations for DBC. All I knew is that I was going to meet some cool people at a similar juncture in their lives and learn something that was far beyond anything I had ever done before, supported almost solely by the encouragement of my roommate and friend who truly believed that I was capable of doing well enough to "pass" but to do so awesomely.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm already amazed by my other cohort participants. They're unbelievably eager to help and own up to questions which is comforting to a girl who has never stepped foot into a basic programming class and lives in fear of failing.
				</p>
				<p>
					I predict that this type of environment will vastly change me as not only a learner, but a human. I've already started on a journey to learning more about mindfulness and practicing meditation more frequently. What I originally thought was going to be a fast-paced cram session of learning Ruby on Rails has already become something that has affected how I view the world and myself entirely.
				</p>
				<p>
					I spent most of my first week working through Phase 0 in absolute fear that I was not qualified to "be here". To have this chance to do something that feels like too much of a stretch. It's hard to be a student again after a few years working fairly independently and successfully, but after watching a recent video, I realized that I am qualified. I made it through the interview. I made it through the pre-requisites. My friends clearly saw enough in me to direct me this way.
				</p>
				<p>
					It's easy to say now that I'm feeling more confident, but I'm looking forward to the challenge.
