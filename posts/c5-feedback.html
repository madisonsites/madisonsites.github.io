				<h1>Pairing</h1>
				<p>
					When we were first introduced to the concept of pairing through problems, I was, well, apprehensive to say the least. The idea of waiting on someone else or, worse, holding others back was terrifying and frustrating to me.
				</p>
				<p>
					Fortunately, it's been nothing but positive. The time to solve problems goes by so quickly not only because there's two brains attacking them, but it's fun along the way. It puts the human element into programming. It's unbelievably rewarding to help something click for someone and I'm so grateful when that person is me, and it usually is.
				</p>
				<p>
					It can definitely be frustrating to work with another person when you're both feeling exasperated or stuck. This happened for the first time with my last pair. That's right, it took five weeks for me to feel any exasperation in pairing which I'm pretty proud of. We were both so downtrodden it was nearly comical. Each of us feared trying something and couldn't seem to communicate an idea at all, it was a terrible cycle. When everything finally came together, the sense of relief and accomplishment was so much greater after all the effort.
				</p>
				<h1>Pairing</h1>
				<p>
					My feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Actually, it has been so positive it almost worries me that people are simply being too nice, ha!
				</p>
				<p>
					Thus far, the feedback hasn't directly effected my learning, but my communication. I think as we delve deeper into things I'll benefit more and more on the education side of it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Because of this, I'm working harder to communicate more effectively: by listening more and making my thoughts more explicit.
				</p>
				<p>
					Writing feedback is a challenge of its own. Most of the time I feel like I can't add anything constructive, which makes me feel like a bit of a waste as pair partner. I'm trying to do my feedback as soon as I can afterwards so that I can have a stronger memory and be a better pair overall.
				</p>
				<h1>Pairing &amp; Feedback in Education</h1>
				<p>
					In summation, they're the group projects you dread, but actually end up being far more productive. They add another layer to what we've been learning, which is especially nice since we're online-only right now, making the experience a bit more multi-dimensional. And, in the future, we're making things for humans after all and they shouldn't be forgotten in the process.
