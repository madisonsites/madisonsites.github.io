      Hello world!
      </p>
      <p>
      To some of you, that's just a simple salutation. To others that have already passed into the world I have just entered, that's a half joke.
      </p>

      <p>
      I guess this is as good a time as any to tell you that I've started a new adventure. Somehow riding my bike 545 miles last week just wasn't enough and here I am, beginning a four-month journey of learning something entirely different through Dev BootCamp.
    </p>
    <p>
        But, enough about me, this post is supposed to be about some concepts I learned this week. And I would say the theme of this week was the multi-player experience.
        </p>
        <p>
        Growing up, we weren't allowed to rent one-player video games from Blockbuster (#Throwback). As a family of four kids, my mother simply couldn't stand the fighting. What took one week of promises that we could share was dismantled in mere minutes. And so what seemed like a lifelong sentence to multiplayer began.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the world of coding, especially open source projects, things like version control are essential. Even if you're rolling on through a one-player game (Thanks for being both a one and multi-player game, Donkey Kong!), you still have to keep things straight with yourself. Because if you mess up and get hit by a rolling barrel or mistakenly introduce a bug with your new code, you can always revert back to that checkpoint (that beautiful barrel with white stars).
        </p>
        <p>
        The idea of version control is that these different points are managed cleanly, assuming you've left yourself great commit messages along the way that indicate what you modified in this commit. Each commit is like a beautiful save beacon or a white-starred barrel in this analogy.
        </p>
        <p>
        Git does a great job of managing these changes by saving each of your commits (unlimited save barrels!) separately.
        </p>
        <p>
        And GitHub is where these great things go to live online. A place where you can compare scores, er, maybe just learn a thing or two from other people on how they beat the weird rat boss/solved your problem with more efficiency. And, who knows, you could be fortunate enough to get feedback from other great developers on your code (think Cranky Kong, but [often] way nicer).
        </p>
        <p>
        And as a pure project tool, it allows you to work alongside people around the globe on a single project, without overriding anyone's work.
        </p>
        <p>
        GitHub is more than just collaboration, it's a beautiful format to see how your project has grown and changed. And maybe how you've manage to develop as well.
        </p>
        <p>
        And on that note, I guess I should thank my brothers for making me an acceptable multiplayer, but moreso DBC for nudging me to be a better one.
